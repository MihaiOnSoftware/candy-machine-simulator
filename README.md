# Candy Machine Simluator

This is based off of the Functional Programming in Scala 6.11 exercise. I wrote this blindly and then looked at the official solution, which while actually very similar in terms of functionality seems to me to be very hard to parse. So I'm leaving this up here as an alternative to show that funcitonal code doesn't have to be arcane and filled with underscores.
